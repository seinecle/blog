I am a social scientist and Java developer with a passion for discovering insights in big texts, networks and in unstructured data in general.

### Work in social science

* In my 20s for my PhD under the guidance of [Philippe Fontaine](https://isp.cnrs.fr/?project=fontaine-philippe), I digged in archives (boxes of documents! plenty of boxes!) to write a contextualized [history of economics and biology in post-WWII USA](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00372263).
* In my 30s under the guidance of [Paul Wouters](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=ZHF-hVMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Ale Smidts](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6699-1172), I used scientometric data and survey data to [map the field of neuroeconomics](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3354) and related disciplines. I relied a lot on [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), a software for the visualization of networks.
* Now in my 40s and a professor at [em lyon business school](https://em-lyon.com/en), my goal is to continue using texts and networks to shed different and interesting lights on social science issues, AND to make the tools I develop accessible to the public. This is the sense of [Nocodefunctions](https://nocodefunctions.com/).

### Programming

Working with bigger texts and networks, I switched from using Excel to Java in 2011. The tools I created are scattered in academic publications, private and public Github repos, and websites which emerged and died. Examples of contributions:

* Umigon, best of class [sentiment analysis for social media](https://nocodefunctions.com/umigon/sentiment_analysis_tool.html).
* [A method to map Twitter fields, at scale](https://management-aims.com/index.php/mgmt/article/view/4245/10254).
* [Gephi plugins](https://gephi.org/plugins/#/browse/search/levallois) and [Gephi tutorials](https://seinecle.github.io/gephi-tutorials/).

### Today

I am now trying to increase the public impact of my academic work. In 2021 I started developping [Nocodefunctions](https://nocodefunctions.com/). It is a platform offering the tools I developed over the years, for non technical users and for free. It will also be the host and training ground for the new functions I am developing in my current academic projects.
