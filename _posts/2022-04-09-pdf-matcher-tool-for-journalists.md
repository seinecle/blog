*A new function has been added to Nocodefunctions.com in response to a need by journalists*

# The need: helping journalists sift through pdfs

Early April, journalist Runa Sandvik posted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Imagine having 1000 PDFs and needing to find those with specific keywords. Here’s a tool many, many journalists need that someone could easily write and share. 🔍🗞<br><br>- Take PDFs as input<br>- Convert to text <br>- Search for keywords (UTF-8)<br>- Output result as CSV</p>&mdash; Runa Sandvik (@runasand) <a href="https://twitter.com/runasand/status/1510246476315865095?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2022</a></blockquote>

It felt like a feature Nocodefunction.com was well positioned to offer. So I ended up developing it in exactly a Sunday afternoon, and you can now find it here:

[https://nocodefunctions.com/pdfmatcher/pdf_matcher_tool.html](https://nocodefunctions.com/pdfmatcher/pdf_matcher_tool.html).

I reported it to Runa:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi, please find the function here:<a href="https://t.co/N9oM7dBOPN">https://t.co/N9oM7dBOPN</a><br><br>The export to Excel stalls for some reason but otherwise the results can be seen on the page. Please submit bug reports etc. to analysis@exploreyourdata.com<br><br>(free to use, respectful of the data, of course!)</p>&mdash; Clement Levallois (@seinecle) <a href="https://twitter.com/seinecle/status/1510661117768515586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2022</a></blockquote>

... and I was disappointed to get no reply. But looking back at the original post, I realized it got tons of replies (91 so far), with "less than helpful comments" but also pointers to super useful resources.
