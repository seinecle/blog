Technology in the classroom has become an urgent issue. Laptops, smartphones, and now generative AI are increasingly depriving students of one of their most precious assets: their attention. In this blog post, I argue that these challenges demand distinct responses.

# <u>Generative AI</u> in the Classroom: Robbing Students of Their Attention
A recent article argues convincingly that [generative AI in the classroom robs students of experiencing "learning"](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55577d2fe4b02de6a6ea49cd/t/67dfeb8d9ff3a5472a6d719d/1742728078061/Drimmer_Nygren_Not_Using_AI.pdf). Instead of pondering, exploring, and reflecting on a subject, students now simply write a prompt and, with one click, generate the response the teacher expects.

The authors are clear about the damage this causes: when students rely on generative AI, they focus on delivering content rather than engaging in the process of creation, imagination, and critical judgment. In this process, what they lose is their ability to concentrate—their attention. Students no longer truly engage with the subject; they do not learn to focus on a task for a sustained period.

This is a catastrophic development—not only does it undermine the mission of schools and universities to shape well-rounded, critical thinkers, but it also jeopardizes vocational prospects. Graduates who never learn to focus and think independently will struggle to thrive in complex professional environments.

# <u>Electronic Devices</u> in the Classroom: Robbing Students of Their Attention
Another article from 2019 makes a similar argument for electronic devices: [using Internet-enabled devices in the classroom divides attention and decreases academic performance](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/centre-for-teaching-and-learning/media-library/teaching-institute/2019/dividing-attention-in-the-classroom-reduces-exam-performance.pdf). Although technology is introduced in classrooms for valid reasons (e.g., easier note-taking, quick access to information), it ultimately distracts students and diminishes their ability to focus on the subject. A recent thread on X highlights [a debate between a professor who banned screens for this reason and the reactions that followed](https://x.com/HKBradshaw/status/1880322152999841983).

# Removing Generative AI and Electronic Devices from the Classroom?
Here I shift from summarizing research to sharing my personal experience. I spent 10 years conducting studies and research in the history and sociology of science, followed by 10 years as a professor at a business school, and now I serve as the head of department at a school of visual arts (with a focus on interactive design and video games). I am also deeply involved in [software development for text mining and network visualization](https://nocodefunctions.com/) and [teaching about generative AI](https://ai-for-professionals.com/).

## Preserving and Training Students' Attention: <u>Defensive</u> Measures
I have witnessed students completely losing focus due to their use of smartphones and laptops in class. In one instance, while teaching in a classroom that had a window panel connecting to an adjacent room, I could see that while the professor was actively engaging students—pointing at the blackboard and encouraging participation— her students were silently watching YouTube videos.

For a long time, I banned laptops in my classes. I would instruct, "Open your laptop—we're going to do an exercise that requires accessing online resources," and then say, "The exercise is now over; please close your laptop." This approach was effective, though not without resistance. Sometimes I was too tired to call out the students who kept glancing at their phones under their laps. I even occasionally had to call out students for using their phones beneath their desks, then realizing they were merely picking their nails—an embarrassing moment for me. Yet it worked; students were paying attention.

In classes where laptops and desktops are essential tools—such as in Bachelor's programs in game art or interactive design—it's more challenging to enforce these measures, as computers cannot simply be switched off. Nevertheless, the effort to cultivate students' attention must continue. Now that I am a faculty administrator rather than a classroom professor, I offer these suggestions rather than actions I would personally enforce:

- **Enforce focused screen use:** Inform students that screen use must be strictly related to the subject at hand—not for mindless browsing—and enforce this rule consistently.
- **Ban smartphones in the classroom:** Even if students argue that they need them for note-taking or because their computer is malfunctioning, maintain the ban.
- **Make accommodations for disabilities:** Provide appropriate academic accommodations for students who require smartphones or other devices for accessibility reasons.

## Training Students' Attention: <u>Active</u> Measures
There is also a more "active" approach to developing students' attention that can be implemented concurrently. This method involves engaging students directly by highlighting the stakes of losing attention and inviting them to train it. The article cited above describes an art history class exercise:

> An exercise that compels students to become aware of the process by which they formulate responses to our prompts is one of the most traditional pedagogical exercises in the art historian’s toolkit. Drimmer [co-author of the paper] has students sit in a dim classroom, look at a work in silence for twenty minutes, and jot their thoughts.  
> The class then reconvenes not only to talk about their observations but also to reflect on what that process was like. They always say, “it’s hard.” Without fail, they articulate how challenging it felt to maintain their focus when they thought they had nothing left to write and then how unexpected it was to be able to work through a barrier of stultification toward discovering more to see, to think about, and to write.  
> -- <cite>How We are Not Using AI in the Classroom by Sonja Drimmer & Christopher J. Nygren (ICMA News, 2025)</cite>

I find this exercise particularly effective in illustrating to students what "attention" truly means. At the same time, I would argue that generative AI is not inherently an attention-killer and can be introduced to students in a constructive manner.

# Introducing Generative AI in the Classroom with Three Actions  
*Not as a prompting machine/attention-killer, but as a tool for production*

Generative AI is likely—indeed, I would even say certainly—becoming as fundamental as computers in the professional lives of the students we prepare for graduation. While its integration is still "in progress," there is ample evidence that writing, coding, creating visual assets, and researching topics are increasingly performed with the assistance of generative AI. Heck, I'm using ChatGPT to help me refine [some markdown finesses](https://chatgpt.com/share/67e91600-cfa0-8001-9d7c-2b7ebf69659e) in the formatting of this page, to polish the writing of this blog post (since I am not a native English speaker), and even to later create a French version—a task that might otherwise take me an hour but now only takes ten minutes with generative AI.

The resolution to the contradiction—where generative AI is seen as both a threat to students' attention and an essential tool—is to treat it as an object of study rather than merely a prompting machine. This can be achieved through three key actions, introduced **as early as possible in the curriculum**:

1. **Introduce generative AI as a subject** in a culture and humanities class.
2. **Teach students how to use it** as one of the tools in the creative process—not as a replacement for creativity.
3. **Revise assignments and syllabi** to clearly indicate when the use of generative AI is beneficial and permitted, and when it is detrimental and therefore not allowed.

In my view, actions 1 and 2 should be integrated into the curriculum as early as possible, since understanding generative AI is becoming a fundamental form of literacy. Failing to do so will inevitably lead students to use these technologies in the worst possible manner.

Action 3 is more complex. Currently, most policies simply ban the use of generative AI for assignments—a stance understandable given that students might sacrifice the learning process and their capacity for sustained attention. However, generative AI can be a valuable tool in creative production—provided that it is explained, critically examined, and its use is taught. Only then can students be expected to use it responsibly, preparing them for a future (which is already our present, in my view) where it is as commonplace as a word processor. An outright ban prevents students from gaining this essential experience, and we are approaching a point where such a ban becomes absurd. While most professors use generative AI daily in their professional activities—and some even explore using it for grading assignments—we still accuse students of cheating when they employ it.

# A Test: What Policy on the Use of Generative AI for a Creative Essay?
Consider a common scenario: what should be the policy when an assignment is designed to evaluate a student's ability to write a creative essay on a given topic or to present a coherent artistic proposition with supporting visual assets in response to a brief?

My proposal is as follows:

- **Precondition:** The curriculum must have introduced generative AI within a culture and humanities class.
- **Precondition:** The fundamentals of using generative AI should have been taught beforehand.
- **For the specific assignment:** Instead of imposing an outright ban or full permission, generative AI should be allowed for certain explicit functions while being disallowed for others.

Drafting a detailed list of which features of generative AI are permitted for each assignment is a complex task. One practical solution is to specify what is explicitly banned and require students to document how they used generative AI. Although this approach may seem bureaucratic, it better addresses the complexity of the issue than a blanket ban or unrestricted authorization.
