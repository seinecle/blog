Technology in the classroom has become an urgent issue. Phones in the classroom, and now generative AI, are concurring to rob students from a most precious skill or capacity: their attention. In this blog post, I argue that these issues should receive different responses.

# Generative AI in the classroom: robbing students from their attention
A recent article argues convincingly that generative AI in the classroom robs students from experiencing "learning". Instead of pondering, exploring, reflecting on a subject, students now write a prompt and generate in a click whatever response the teacher was expecting from them.
The authors are very clear about the damage that is causes: a student using generative AI to generate a response is focusing on delivering the content instead of focsuing on experiencing the process of creation, exploration, imagination and formation of a judgement leading to the final product. What the student loses in the process can be captured by the term "attention". Students don't attend to the subject, they do not learn to gather and focus their attention on a task for a sustained period.

# Electronic devices in the classroom: robbing students from their attention
Another recent article argues the same, but in the case of electronic devices: using Internet-enabled devices in the classroom divide attention and decreases academic performance. This is an older and well covered topic. The study confirms once more that technology in the classroom can be introduced for comprehensible motives (easier note taking, access to Wikipedia, etc.) end up distracting students and hurt their capacity to attend to the subject taught in class.

# Removing generative AI and electronic devices from the classroom?
Here I switch from reporting readings to sharing my opinions based on my experience: studies and research in history and sociology of science for 10 years, then a professor in a business school for 10 years and now head of department in a school of visual arts (interactive design, and video games) for almost a year. Also very much invested in software development and teaching about generative AI.

## Actively training student's attention
I have witnessed the total loss of attention by students, due to their use of smartphones and laptops in class. While it happened in my classes, I remember this one time when I was teaching in a room that had a window panel, that connected to the classroom next to it. So that I could see the back of the students in the other classroom, and the professor in front of them. The professor was engaged in his teaching, pointing to the blackboard and stimulating students in participating. Meanwhile, the students I could see were watching Youtube videos in mute.
I have for a long time banned laptops in my classes. "Open your laptop, we are going to make an exercise where you need to online resources". "The exercise is now over, please close your laptop". That was how I proceeded and it worked. Not easily (students resist a lot, and I was sometimes too tired to call out students who, once more, glanced at their phones on their laps. I also sometimes called out students for attending to their phones undr their desk instead of my lecture, when they were just picking their nails. Embarrassing. Yet it worked. Students were attending the lecture.

In the context of a class where laptops and desktops are the tools of the trade (Bachelor in game art, Bachelor in interactive design), things are more difficult as laptops can't be switched off. Still, I think that the struggle for cultivating students' attention should be conducted. I am now a faculty admin not a professor in the classroom anymore, so these are suggestions not actions I would take myself:

- tell the students that screen use is in relation to the subject discussed in class, not mindless browsing. Then efforcing this rule.
