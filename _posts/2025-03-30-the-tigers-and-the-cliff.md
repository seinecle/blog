Technology in the classroom has become an urgent issue. Laptops or phones in the classroom, and now generative AI, are concurring to rob students from a most precious skill or capacity: their attention. In this blog post, I argue that these issues should receive different responses.

# <u>Generative AI</u> in the classroom: robbing students from their attention
A recent article argues convincingly that [generative AI in the classroom robs students from experiencing "learning"](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55577d2fe4b02de6a6ea49cd/t/67dfeb8d9ff3a5472a6d719d/1742728078061/Drimmer_Nygren_Not_Using_AI.pdf). Instead of pondering, exploring, reflecting on a subject, students now write a prompt and generate in a click whatever response the teacher was expecting from them.
The authors are very clear about the damage that is causes: a student using generative AI to generate a response is focusing on delivering the content instead of focsuing on experiencing the process of creation, imagination and formation of a judgement leading to the final product. What the student loses in the process can be captured by the term "attention". Students don't attend to the subject, they do not learn to gather and focus their attention on a task for a sustained period of time. This is a catastrophic development, both in terms of the mission of schools and universities to train humans ans citizens as fully formed critical thinkers, but also more pragmatically in terms of vocational prospects: graduates who didn't learn to properly focus and think by themselves will have a hard time perform in complex professional environments.

# <u>Electronic devices</u> in the classroom: robbing students from their attention
Another article from 2019 argues the same, but in the case of electronic devices: [using Internet-enabled devices in the classroom divide attention and decreases academic performance](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/centre-for-teaching-and-learning/media-library/teaching-institute/2019/dividing-attention-in-the-classroom-reduces-exam-performance.pdf). This is an older and well covered topic. The study confirms once more that technology in the classroom can be introduced for comprehensible motives (easier note taking, access to Wikipedia, etc.) but ends up distracting students and hurt their capacity to attend to the subject taught in class. A recent thread on X mentions the article from 2019 shows the [debate between a professor banning screens for this reason, and reactions to it](https://x.com/HKBradshaw/status/1880322152999841983).

# Removing generative AI and electronic devices from the classroom?
Here I switch from reporting readings to sharing my experience: studies and research in history and sociology of science for 10 years, then a professor in a business school for 10 years and now head of department in a school of visual arts (interactive design, and video games) for almost a year. Also very much invested in [software development for text mining and network visualization](https://nocodefunctions.com/) and [teaching about generative AI](https://ai-for-professionals.com/).

## Preserving and training student's attention: defense measures
I have witnessed the total loss of attention by students, due to their use of smartphones and laptops in class. While it happened in my classes, I remember this one time when I was teaching in a classroom that had a window panel that connected to the classroom next to it. So that I could see the back of the students in the other room, and the professor in front of them. The professor was engaged in his teaching, pointing to the blackboard and stimulating students in participating. Meanwhile, the students I could see were watching Youtube videos in mute.
I have for a long time banned laptops in my classes. "Open your laptop, we are going to make an exercise where you need to access online resources". "The exercise is now over, please close your laptop". That was how I proceeded, and it worked. Not easily (students resist a lot, and I was sometimes too tired to call out students who, once more, glanced at their phones on their laps). I also sometimes called out students for attending to their phones undr their desk instead of my lecture, when they were just picking their nails. Embarrassing. Yet it worked. Students were attending the lecture.

In the context of a class where laptops and desktops are the tools of the trade (Bachelor in game art, Bachelor in interactive design), things are more difficult as computers can't be switched off. Still, I think that the struggle for cultivating students' attention should be conducted. I am now a faculty admin not a professor in the classroom anymore, so these are suggestions not actions I would take myself:

- tell the students that screen use is in relation to the subject discussed in class, not mindless browsing. Then efforcing this rule.
- ban smartphones in the classroom. Students might argue that they use it to take notes, or that their computer is broken so that they need their smartphone: I would resist these arguments.
- an exception is with students with a disability; an academic accomodation should be put in place. 

## Training student's attention: active measures
There is a more "active" approach to the development of student's attention that can be pursued in parallel, which consists in involving the students in the issue: presenting them with the stakes of the loss of attention, inviting them to train their attention, and opening for them the possibility to use generative AI in a thoughtful way.

The article cited above mentions a class exercise performed in art history:

> An exercise that compels students to become aware of the process by which they formulate responses to our prompts is one of the most traditional pedagogical exercises in the art historian’s toolkit. Drimmer [co-author of the paper] has students sit in a dim classroom, look at a work in silence for twenty minutes, and jot their thoughts.  
The class then reconvenes not only to talk about their observations but also to reflect on what that process was like. They always say, “it’s hard.” Without fail, they articulate how challenging it felt to maintain their focus when they thought they had nothing left to write and then how unexpected it was to be able to work through a barrier of stultification toward discovering more to see, to think about, and to write.

## Introducing generative AI in the classroom - not as a prompting machine but as a tool of production
Generative AI is most probably (I'd even say "certainly") becoming as fundamental as computers themselves in the professional lifes of the students we prepare for graduation. Things are still "in progress" but by every indication, the practice of writing, coding, creating visual assets, researching a topic, etc. etc. is already widely performed with the assistance of generative AI. Heck, I'll use ChatGPT to assist me with [some markdown finesses](https://chatgpt.com/share/67e91600-cfa0-8001-9d7c-2b7ebf69659e), to polish this blog post (I am not an English native speaker), then to create a version in French for it, which I could do myself (I am a French native speaker) but that would take me one hour, when I'll do it in 10 minutes with the assistance of generative AI.

The way out of the contradiction (generative AI hurts student's attention, yet generative AI is this common place tech students need to know) is to introduce generative AI as an object of study, not as a prompting machine. This can be done in three ways, **as soon as possible in the curriculum**:

1. introduce generative AI as a subject in a class on culture and humanities 
2. teach students how to use it: as one of the tools in a chain of creative process, not as a substitute for the creative process
3. revise the assignments in each class / syllabus and make it explicit when then use of generative AI is beneficial to the learning experience and allowed, and when it is detrimental and hence not allowed

Actions 1 and 2 should be (IMHO) introduced as soon as possible in the curriculum because this is basic literacy. Not doing it will conduct students to use these technologies nonetheless, in the worst way possible.

Action 3 is complicated. Today, AFAIK, most policies consist in just banning generative AI for assignments. This is fully understandable, given what we discussed just above: students use generative AI at the expense of developing a learning experience, a capacity for attention. Yet, generative AI can be used as one of the tools in a toolkit for creative production, and students should be prepared for a future (professional and otherwise) where this is as commonplace as using a word processor. Banning generative AI prevents students from making this experience, and we are reaching a point where this becomes absurd. Professors in some corners explore how to grade assignments with generative AI - while we would accuse students of cheating when they use it, even in a creative way?
