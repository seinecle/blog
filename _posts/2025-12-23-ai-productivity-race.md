# Since LLMs are clever, cheap and available on tap ...
This is the current meme reflecting the merry-go-round of weekly improvements of AI models:

<img width="640" height="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b67de1e8-941e-4bd1-a8b4-8d0510fd7e0c" />

(other versions of this meme do include Anthropic's Claude, if you wonder)

Productivity for AI assisted tasks would be driven by this endless cycle, this race to the [bottom of costs](https://epoch.ai/data-insights/llm-inference-price-trends) and [hallucination rates](https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard) and the [heights of task completion duration](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/).

With LLMs becoming more performant and cheaper every week we would be swimming in virtually infinite intelligence to assist in any of our projects. Creativity and time, not our initial skillset, would become the limit to what we can accomplish.

In practice though, tooling comes in the way.
