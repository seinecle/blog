# Since LLMs are more clever, cheaper by the day and available on tap...
... we would be swimming in virtually infinite intelligence to assist in any of our projects.
Creativity and time, not our coding skills, would become the limit to what we can accomplish.

This is the popular meme reflecting the merry-go-round of weekly improvements of AI models:

<img width="640" height="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b67de1e8-941e-4bd1-a8b4-8d0510fd7e0c" />

(other versions of this meme do include Anthropic's Claude, if you wonder)

Productivity for AI assisted tasks would be increasing steadily, driven by this endless cycle. We benefit from a race to the bottom of [costs](https://epoch.ai/data-insights/llm-inference-price-trends) and [hallucination rates](https://github.com/vectara/hallucination-leaderboard), with constantly new heights for [task completion duration](https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/) and [overall performance](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emollick_no-signs-of-an-end-to-rapid-gains-in-ai-ability-activity-7407157959958351873-9Y1h).

In practice though, tooling comes in the way.

# Tooling: the essential layer

Making use of generative AI in a coding task is actually not straightforward. Here are some essential milestones in the short history for this process.

Ratings are my subjective opinion in terms of usefulness as of December 2025
