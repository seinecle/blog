With the end of the free Twitter API, network analysts are looking for new data sources. This is an opportunity to stimulate the ecosystem of apps that specialize in data import and transformation to networks.

# End of the Twitter API: a problem, and an opportunity
A large crowd of diverse actors relied on the Twitter API to collect data for text analysis, network analysis or both.
Just taking academics, you find a rapidly growing number of publications mentioning the "Twitter API" in recent years:

|  year | count of publications  |
|---|---|
| 2018  | 2,480  |
| 2019  | 2,620  |
| 2020  |3,100   |
| 2021  | 3,890  |

This is over with the new plans for API access [set at prohibitive prices](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api).

What's next?
Academics but others as well (OSINT, journalists, marketers, developers, etc.) turn to other data sources.
Here are the data sources that I consider, and that I heard others considering:

- [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/46.449/2.210) ([API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API))
- Wikipedia / [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) ([API](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_access/en))
- Spotify ([API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api))
- Reddit (well... [not anymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy))
- Mastodon ([API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/))
- [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) (this one is quite specialized but really worth a look: gigantic, free access to global scientometric data).

The obvious reaction is: none of these are an equivalent to Twitter.
It will take a mourning period but yes, we'll have to move on.
Not saying that Twitter data will not become available once more, one day, but waiting for this to happen, human curiosity must find other objects to apply to.

> **Prediction ðŸ”®: we are going to see, in the next months and over 2024, an intense activity of developing importers and user interfaces for these alternative data sources mentioned above.**

# New data importers, new user interfaces: a call to talk and exchange
In informal discussions and reading posts from specialists on Twitter, I see that:

- there is an interest in new data importers, either for one's own use or as a service to offer
- accordinly, tech-savy individuals, organizations and app developers are building new data importers
- the same actors are developing transformers for this data: text and network analysis methods (otherwise offering raw data is not of great value)
- this triggers a re-thinking of exisiting user interfaces, and the development of new ones

**Why would we need to do this in isolation?**
After giving it some thoughts, I think that there are two big reasons not to engage in collaborations, and one of them is a false one.

One reason not to engage in collaborations is to keep one's product secret and non reproducible, to build a competitive advantage.
A data importer with some clever data transformation added to it can deliver insights of great value, so let's not share it.

A second reason could be technical and resources constraints.
Working alone can let you go faster, as collaborating adds coordination and interfacing costs and delays.

This second reason is less strong I believe.
Coordination and interfacing costs are real, but setting up a collaboration also helps distribute work among many, instead of doing everything by one's self.
Let's consider the steps for a service consisting in, say, creating a word cloud from the most common expressions used in a set of Wikipedia pages.
Constructing the word cloud is far from the only operation we need.

Are you ready to design and implement each of these 7 operations, and especially the 8th one?

1. Creating a interface (web, mobile app or desktop?) where the user will express their query
2. Hosting this interface (server costs, maintenance of the app for multiple OS...)
3. Finding the API client for Wikipedia and querying the data, keeping track of the changes in the API
4. Parsing and cleaning the data
5. Constructing the word cloud
6. Formatting the results: a picture of the cloud, a table view of the underlying words, a gexf network format for the underlying network of relations?
7. An interface to export the results: showing the picture on screen, downloading the picture in different formats (svg, png?), exporting to Excel and Google Sheets, visualize the word cloud in an interactive way with Gephi Lite, VOSviewer online or a custom D3 view, export a gexf or GraphML to be opened by Gephi or NodeXL?
8. Maintaining steps 1 to 7 through time.

I believe that relatively big for-profit organizations have a motive and the resources to handle these 7 steps all by themselves (even then, they rely and contribute to open source solutions for parts of the process!)

For smaller organizations (for profit or not) and individuals, there is a strong case to join forces when and if possible, to help each other on one or several steps of the process above.


# I go first: what I am happy to help with

The list below are functional blocks that I can relatively easily provide to you, in a format that suits your needs.

## Tools

- methods to [extract words](https://github.com/seinecle/umigon-tokenizer) and [n-grams](https://github.com/seinecle/umigon-ngram-ops) from a given text
- methods to convert [co-occurring words into a network of words](https://github.com/seinecle/cowo-function)
- methods to infer the [sentiment from a text](https://github.com/seinecle/umigon-family/tree/main/umigon-core)

## Interfaces

-  you are free to add your method to [https://nocodefunctions.com](https://nocodefunctions.com)
-  interface between your app and nocodefunctions.com

*(this one seems like: "ah ah I see your ulterior motive for all this, you want to grow your web app!" I would be happy to, that is true. I also know that many developers don't have the time to maintain their own web app, so I offer this for them).*

## Import / export

- from a csv, txt, pdf or Excel file to the plain text they contain
- from a gexf or graphML file to a url to visualize this file on the web

# "How to start collaborating? I code in R / Python / JS and I don't know how to do X, Y or Z"
This is not hard actually, we'll figure out a way to coordinate. Let's get in touch, either privately ([analysis@exploreyourdata.com](mailto:analysis@exploreyourdata.com)) or let's discuss pubblicly on [@seinecle](https://twitter.com/seinecle) or [Mastodon](https://ioc.exchange/@seinecle).

# About me
I am a [professor at emlyon business school](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levallois/) where I conduct research in Natural Language Processing and network analysis applied to social sciences and the humanities. I teach about the impact of digital technologies on business and society. I  build [nocode functions](https://nocodefunctions.com) ðŸ”Ž, a click and point web app to explore texts and networks. It is [fully open source](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions). Try it and give some feedback, I would appreciate it!

* you can also read [the other articles of this blog](https://nocodefunctions.com/blog) ðŸ‘“, where I write about the process of developing the app.
