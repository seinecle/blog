With the end of the free Twitter API, network analysts are looking for new data sources. This is an opportunity to stimulate the ecosystem of apps that specialize in data import and transformation to networks.

# End of the Twitter API: a problem, and an opportunity
A large crowd of diverse actors relied on the Twitter API to collect data for text analysis, network analysis or both. Just taking academics, you find a rapidly growing number of publications mentioning the "Twitter API" in recent years:

|  year | count of publications  |
|---|---|
| 2018  | 2,480  |
| 2019  | 2,620  |
| 2020  |3,100   |
| 2021  | 3,890  |

This is over with the new plans for API access [set at prohibitive prices](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api).

What's next? Academics but others as well (OSINT, journalists, marketers, developers, etc.) turn to other data sources. Here are the data sources that I consider, and that I heard others considering:

- [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/46.449/2.210) ([API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API))
- Wikipedia / [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) ([API](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_access/en))
- Spotify ([API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api))
- Reddit (well... [not anymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy))
- Mastodon ([API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/))
- [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) (this one is quite specialized but really worth a look: gigantic, free access to global scientometric data).

The obvious reaction is: none of these are an equivalent to Twitter. It will take a mourning period but yes, we'll have to move on. Not saying that Twitter data will not become available once more, one day, but waiting for this to happen, human curiosity must find other objects to apply to.

> **We are going to see, in the next months and over 2024, an intense activity of developing importers and user interfaces for these alternative data sources mentioned above.**


# New data importers, new user interfaces: a call to talk and exchange
In informal discussions and reading posts from specialists on Twitter, I see that:

- there is an interest in new data importers, either for one's own use or as a service to offer
- accordinly, tech-savy individuals, organizations and app developers are building new data importers
- the same actors are developing transformers for this data: text and network analysis methods (otherwise offering raw data is not of great value)
- this triggers a re-thinking of exisiting user interfaces, and the development of new ones

Why would we need to do this in isolation? Some reasons to avoid collaborations:

- building a competitive advantage. A data importer with some clever data transformation added to it can deliver insights of great value, so let's not share it.
- technical and resources constraints. Working alone can let you go faster, and collaborating adds coordination and interfacing costs and delays

# About me
I am a [professor at emlyon business school](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levallois/) where I conduct research in Natural Language Processing and network analysis applied to social sciences and the humanities. I teach about the impact of digital technologies on business and society. I  build [nocode functions](https://nocodefunctions.com) ðŸ”Ž, a click and point web app to explore texts and networks. It is [fully open source](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions). Try it and give some feedback, I would appreciate it!
