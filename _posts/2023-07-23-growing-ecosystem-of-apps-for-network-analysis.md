With the end of the free Twitter API, network analysts are looking for new data sources. This is an opportunity to stimulate the ecosystem of apps that specialize in data import and transformation to networks.

# End of the Twitter API: a problem, and an opportunity
A large crowd of diverse actors relied on the Twitter API to collect data for text analysis, network analysis or both. Just taking academics, you find a rapidly growing number of publications mentioning the "Twitter API" in recent years:

|  year | count of publications  |
|---|---|
| 2018  | 2,480  |
| 2019  | 2,620  |
| 2020  |3,100   |
| 2021  | 3,890  |
