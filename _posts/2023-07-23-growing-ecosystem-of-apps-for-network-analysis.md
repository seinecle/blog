With the end of the free Twitter API, network analysts are looking for new data sources. This is an opportunity to stimulate the ecosystem of apps that specialize in data import and transformation to networks.

# About me
I am a [professor at emlyon business school](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levallois/) where I conduct research in Natural Language Processing and network analysis applied to social sciences and the humanities. I teach about the impact of digital technologies on business and society. I  build [nocode functions](https://nocodefunctions.com) ðŸ”Ž, a click and point web app to explore texts and networks. It is [fully open source](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions). Try it and give some feedback, I would appreciate it!
