This is an update on the latest improvements for nocodefunctions.com, with a short video demo!

# The demo
This video showcases a number of new features detailed below:




# Handling first names better
When crawling newspaper website such as lemonde.fr, you might end up with "Emmanuel" or "Anne" appearing as important nodes in the resulting network.
Not because 2 persons with these first names were making the news this day, but because a number of persons named "Emmanuel" and "Anne" were in the news, but unrelated.
These first names should then be removed: they are not meaningful except if they appear frequently with another term - a family name, typically.
For instance "Emmanuel" should be removed, but "Emmanuel Macron" should stay, as well as "Pierre-Emmanuel Barr√©", if both are frequently mentioned in the web pages.

üßπ the removal of isolated first names is now conducted by default. Enjoy!

# Fully responsive
Nocodefunctions.com is very simple to use: 1Ô∏è‚É£ upload a file or select a website to crawl, 2Ô∏è‚É£ click on "run", 3Ô∏è‚É£ watch on screen / download / share the results.
Really something that can be done from a browser on your mobile phone. But some web pages of nocodefunctions.com didn't display correctly on smartphones.

üì≤ all web pages of nocodefunctions.com now display correctly on smartphones. You can quickly perform and share semantic analyses (especialy of websites) while on mobile!

# Topics are back
The function "Topic detection" in texts was unavailable for the last weeks.
I paused this function to tear it apart, and explore with it how multi-steps functions can one day be developed more easily.
I learned a lot, especially on how NOT to make the web app a mess (spaghetti code) to achieve this objective.

üöÄ topics detection is back, and hopefully what I learned on the way will pave the way to more complex functions.

# Text in multiple languages for semantic networks
I experimented with the semantic analyis of the website of devoxx.fr
Devoxx is a very famous conference series for developers, and #devoxxfr is the French edition of this series that took place last week.
The result was disappointing because, as it happens, devoxx.fr has web pages in French and English.
I had selected "French" as the language for the website, and for this reason pages in English were treated as if they were in French - messing up with the detection of stopwords.
As a result, a lot of English stopwords ("the"... "have"... "a lot" ... etc) were visible in the final graph - not helpful at all.
Envetually, it was a relatively small development effort to implement multiple languages, instead of just one.
The results are much cleaner, see the [graph of the devoxx.fr website](https://nocodefunctions.com/user_created_files/vosviewer/index.html?json=public/vosviewer_1786377755738343236.json).

üéå multiple languages can now be selected, when your input text (files, or website) is multilingual

# Next steps
I am working on functions that chain several operations. Without a suprise, I am also working at functions that will rely on generative AI capabilities.
The refactoring work I have done on the Topics detection function (see above) lays the ground for these coming features. Stay tuned and don't hesitate getting touch.

# About Me
I‚Äôm an academic and independent web app developer. I created [nocode functions](https://nocodefunctions.com) üîé, a free, point-and-click tool for exploring texts and networks. It‚Äôs [fully open source](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions). Try it out and let me know what you think‚ÄîI‚Äôd love your feedback!
