This is an update on the latest improvements for nocodefunctions.com, with a short video demo!

# The demo
This video showcases a number of new features detailed below:




# Handling first names better
Generating networks from newspapers shows different issues than for scientific articles: first names are mentioned much more frequently in newspapers.
As a result, for instance, when crawling the lemonde.fr website, you might end up with "Emmanuel" or "Anne" appearing as important nodes in the resulting network.
This is just an artifact though: "Jean" and "Anne" might relate to different persons who just share the same first name.
These names should be removed, except if they appear frequently with another term.
"Emmanuel" should be removed, but "Emmanuel Macron" should stay, as well as "Pierre-Emmanuel Barr√©", if both are frequently mentioned in the web pages.

üßπ the removal of isolated first names is now conducted by default. Enjoy!

# Fully responsive
Nocodefunctions.com is very simple to use: 1Ô∏è‚É£ upload a file or select a website to crawl, 2Ô∏è‚É£ click on "run", 3Ô∏è‚É£ watch the results on screen.
Really something that can be done from a browser on your mobile phone. But some web pages of nocodefunctions.com didn't display correctly on smartphones.

üì≤ all web pages of nocodefunctions.com display now correctly on smartphones. You can now quickly perform and share semantic analyses (especialy of websites) while mobile!

# Topics are back
Topic detection in texts was unavailable for the last weeks.
I paused this function to tear it apart, and explore with it how multi-steps functions can one day be developed more easily.
I learned a lot, especially on how NOT to make the web app a mess (spaghetti code) to achieve this objective.

üöÄ topics detection is back, and hopefully what I learned on the way will pave the way to more complex functions.

# Text in multiple languages for semantic networks
I experimented with the semantic analyis of the website of devoxx.fr.
Devoxx is a very famous conference series for developers, and #devoxxfr is the French edition of this series.
The result was disappointing because, as it happens, devoxx.fr has web pages in French and English.
As I had selected "French" as the language for the website, the pages in English were not properly cleaned.
In the resulting graph, a lot of English stopwords ("the"... "have"... "a lot" ... etc) were visible in the graph - not helpful at all.
As it turns out, it was a small development effort to implement the selection of multiple languages, instead of just one.
The results are much cleaner, see the [graph of the devoxx.fr website](https://nocodefunctions.com/user_created_files/vosviewer/index.html?json=public/vosviewer_1786377755738343236.json).

üéå multiple languages can now be selected, when your input text (files, or website) is multilingual
