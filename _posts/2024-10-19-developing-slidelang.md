This is a very short blog post about [slidelang](https://alpha.slidelang.com/), a new app I am developing.

# What is slidelang?
It is an app that translates Powerpoint documents.

# Why did I start developing it?
Because as a professor, I needed to translate [my course on data science and AI from English to French](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIK6Qb_wufbdJayJn9EWMocfBBIHU__Ux_XIbDh7jCI). It is a Google Slide that contains ~ 300 slides. I found no solution on the market to do it.

# But DeepL, Google Translate... do it already?
Not for my need:

|| [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/fr/pro)    | [Google translate](https://support.google.com/translate/answer/2534559?ref_topic=7011659&hl=en) |  [slidelang](https://alpha.slidelang.com/) |
| --------| --------| -------- | ------- |
|Max size|30 Mb ðŸ˜² |10 Mb ðŸ˜² |300Mb ðŸ˜„|
|Max number of translations per month| 100  | ?    | no limit    |
|Price| $50 / month | free     |  free for now   |
|Uses your data to train their models?|no | unclear (probably yes)     |  no   |
|Preserves layout| yes    | yes    | yes    |
|Quality of translation|excellent    |excellent    |excellent    |

# Does it work well?
I let you judge for yourself:
- [my course in English as a pptx file (132 Mb, 307 slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DccGhUM99qPP_vp0Y569HcmaRXvZyWmE/export/pptx)
- [the translation in French](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D_XD8IJTDtFqXSq2880RDmelHruQjrhz/export/pptx)

The translation took 12 minutes. I am working at making it faster.

# How does it work?
The translation is managed by calls to the OpenAI API. The preservation of the layout is achieved with a complex programmatic process that I designed.

# Is it going to stay free?
No so enjoy it now! I'll create plans that are super cheap compared to what DeepL offers.

# Next
[slidelang](https://alpha.slidelang.com/) is available, up and running. I develop it slowly but surely, aiming to add amazing, useful features. Coming: translation of Google Slides, OpenOffice formats.

# About me
I am academic and independent web app developer. Besides slidelang, I build [nocode functions](https://nocodefunctions.com) ðŸ”Ž, a free click and point web app to explore texts and networks. It is [fully open source](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions). Try it and give some feedback, I would appreciate it!
