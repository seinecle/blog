# Giving back to Gephi - to make sure it thrives in the years to come

I was contacted today by a company representative, telling me they make very good use of Gephi in their activities.
How could they develop collaborations and give back - he was asking?

This blog post is my opinion on this matter.
I am not steering Gephi, so please do not take the following as anything "official" nor definitive on the topic.
Please check the recent posts on the Gephi blog posts by Mathieu Jacomy and Mathieu Bastian to get the latest views from the core Gephi team.

Ok, let's take a bullet point approach:

# 1. Interests should be aligned - and money makes things complicated

Gephi is used by a large diversity of actors: students to governments, librarians, academics and professional scientometricians, social media listeners, citizen journalists, fraud detection analysts and NGO volunteers to professional osint and infosec specialists and many more.

In this list of users, companies would have been natural contributors to the development of Gephi: "take my money, and in exchange I have a voice in Gephi to develop this or that feature".
However Gephi is a free and open source software, and it will not accept funding in return for a right to control how it is developed.

This stance is not a mistake nor a handicap!
It is a conscious choice to evolve Gephi for all - not just in the direction that is set by the stakeholders which can fund it.
But as a result, a very common resource - funding money - is not directly available to Gephi.

This simple absence of a market mechanism (I buy, you deliver) prevented Gephi from accessing resources that would have been so useful - and it is also why I esteem and respect the team who develops this software for so long, to provide it as a [digital commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)).

# 2. So, are we stuck? No!

> The many ways you can contribute to Gephi and get value from it

There are many alternatives to contribute to Gephi, in ways that make the best of your abilities AND with tangible feedbacks beyond the existence of Gephi itself.

*This blog post will be expanded as I get feedback on more possibilities and also contact points (names, emails for specific actions).*

## a. Are you a company or for-profit organization?

At the moment, there is no legal entity that is set to accept funding for Gephi (AFAIK).
However, events sponsored by Gephi can still receive funding, through the university that will host the event for instance.
The Gephi week for 2023 is on the table, for example.

**What to expect from it?**

The 2nd edition of the Gephi week (August 2022) has been extremely productive.
It delivered bug fixes, new plugins, new directions for development but most of all it generated a renewed energy to participate and contribute.
By funding the next edition, you contribute in a very concrete manner to making Gephi more stable in the long term.

## b. Are you an academic?

As an academic (librarian, faculty, student, administrator), a very impactful action is to cite Gephi in the bibliography of the documents your produce - in articles of course but in publication really, including applications and reports.
These are the two papers referencing the tool you love:

> Bastian, M., Heymann, S., & Jacomy, M. (2009, March). Gephi: an open source software for exploring and manipulating networks. In Proceedings of the international AAAI conference on web and social media (Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 361-362).

> Jacomy, M., Venturini, T., Heymann, S., & Bastian, M. (2014). ForceAtlas2, a continuous graph layout algorithm for handy network visualization designed for the Gephi software. PloS one, 9(6), e98679.

**What to expect from it?**
Gephi has an excellent academic standing, with the original contribution cited more than 10,000 times and Gephi being mentioned in over 39,000 academic publications. Explicitly referencing Gephi in your publications contributes to making Gephi visible by making its impact measurable: it ehnances its legitimacy and fosters adoption. And for you, Gephi having an established presence and growing reputation will make it easier to convince reviewer #2 that Gephi was indeed the right choice for this network analysis ;-)

## c. Do you ever write tutorials, how-tos, blog posts?

* Write a simple intro about your experience using Gephi, help others discover it
A classic writer's block about Gephi is that "I am not expert enough" to write about it. You are probably much more expert than you think (see next paragraph), but in any case you can explain and document the use case that you worked on with Gephi.

This is a very, very useful contribution to Gephi. It makes it discoverable, easier to understand and it showcases what it can do. Again, a common conception is that what we do is never "original enough" to be worth writing about. Absolutely not: each dataset or research question has interesting specificities. Help fellow users understand what you did and how you did it! And if the case is confidential, don't let it stop you! Transform and abstract your case and showcase the principles you followed.

* Videos, tweets and shorts are useful, too
I mentioned written pieces because that's in my comfort zone. But videos, short or long, or posts on your favorite social media would be perfectly useful!

**What to expect from it?**
You gain the warm glow of knowing that you helped users discover what is possible with Gephi. Not interested in warm feelings? Then do it for the SEO, as Gephi is at the cross-road of network analysis, data science and data visualization: all SEO boxes checked at once.

## d. Are you moderately experienced with Gephi?

* Chat and contribute to the Gephi group on Facebook!
Yes, Facebook is really anyone's cup of tea. Discord, LinkedIn, Slack, a Wordpress forum... all these would be preferable in some way and yet ten times less used than the group on Facebook. So we stay there for the moment.

The Gephi Facebook group has close to 10,000 members and is a very welcoming and friendly community. Join, post and read! Stuck in any way? Want to showcase a result? Definitely the place to post about it. And if you see anyone requesting assistance, which happens several times per week actually, have a look and it might well be something you have the answer to! Don't be shy to offer your assistance, again my feeling is that we all tend to underestimate how helpful even a small piece of advice or assistance can be.

**What to expect from it?**
Here again, you get a very nice feeling of giving back to the community, and helping somebody who is a beginner just like you were some time ago. Not interested in warm feelings? Contributing to the Gephi Facebook group will also push you up on the learning curve, by exposing you to a variety of cases, questions and solutions that you did not encounter in your usual flow of work with Gephi. A kind of learning platform!


## e. Are you quite experienced with Gephi?

* Join the Slack group for Gephi!
This Slack group exists in some form for many years and is used by the core developers of Gephi. I think it became more widely used at the occasion of the Gephi Week for 2022.

It is different from the Facebook group in the sense that discussions are around organizing and developing Gephi, rather than users helping other users. So it is quite exciting because you can see "Gephi in the making" but to remain productive, it should remain concentrated on that - steering and pushing Gephi forward, not really discussing how to use filters ;-)

If you feel that you could contribute to this kind of discussions, do join here. You are not absolutely certain? Do join and be a listener for the first weeks, and you'll see whether you want to be part of the discussions or not.

**What to expect from it?**
Well, that is super interesting to get close to the core of the Gephi app and community! This is the place where you could learn about the things brewing for the next months, and suggest contributions you can make: in skills, time, money, credit, etc. I would like to emphasize that the most important are contributions (things you can do), not suggestions (things others should do...). The entire group of Gephi core contributors are pretty overwhelmed already, let's give them so help, not a wishlist! :-)















**What to expect from it?**
You gain the warm glow of knowing that you helped users discover what is possible with Gephi. Not interested in warm feelings? Then do it for the SEO, as Gephi is at the cross-road of network analysis, data science and data visualization: all SEO boxes checked at once.
