Is ChatGPT a form of "Artificial General Intelligence" (AGI) or not? I argue that, yes indeed. Keep reading.

# Why do we care whether ChatGPT is AGI or not?
It is not mere semantics or hair splitting.
My argument is that **IF** ChatGPT is **NOT** an AGI, then we have still some years before we have to deal with the consequences.
**If** ChatGPT **is indeed** an AGI, it implies that:

- as we co-exist with an AGI (it is pleonasmic), we should not wait for an hypothetical day when it would arise.
The "when is the singularity happening" would be a misplaced question because it would have happened, without a bang.
The emergence of an AGI would have happended as a series of incremental steps over a few years. We should acknowledge the fact that some early forms of AGI have emerged, and act accordinly in terms of education, health and safety, etc. 

So the question is indeed not trivial.

# Is ChatGPT an AGI? The counter arguments
The consensus is that AGI will arise in decades, or never. "Today" is not an option:

- ![source: https://emerj.com/ai-future-outlook/when-will-we-reach-the-singularity-a-timeline-consensus-from-ai-researchers/](https://github.com/seinecle/blog/assets/1244100/be533c37-682b-443a-9b75-658c836945be)

Considering that AGI would already exist is considered naive, several arguments come to mind:

- large language models (LLMs) are "merely spitting text from powerful statistical associations".
- LLMs are not autonomous, they merely answer to a prompt entered by a human
- they are not self-conscious
- proofs of their non AGI character are the mistakes they make: hallucinations, hands with 8 fingers, non factuality, etc.

# Is ChatGPT an AGI? The arguments in favor
What is an AGI? The definition is muddy. The Wikipedia article, but also everything I read about AI and AGI, list these criteria:

1. self consciousness
2. autonomy
3. ability to accomplish general tasks
4. ability to perfectly mimic various human intelligence
5. ability to perfectly mimic various aspects human cognition (intelligence, emotion, creativity, subjective viewpoint, etc)

I would argue that:

> Large Language Models meet critera 3, 4 and 5.

> Large Language Models don't meet criteria 2, but the current state of technology allows for it

> Criteria 1 is not relevant

Let's review these claims in turn:

## 1. Is self-consciousness an important criteria for AGI? 
Should we wait for a clear sign that LLMs are self-conscious before we declare an AI to be AGI?
I would say, absolutely not. There are many reasons, the one I prefer is that since Freud we have accepted that humans are themselves far from being fully self-conscious.
Cognitive psychology has added piles and piles of more evidence that we humans are conscious of ourselves in some capacity, not in an absolute sense.
In my view, it follows that requiring for an AI to be self-conscious to be declared "AGI" is non sensical - we don't have a yardstick to measure self-consciousness against.
It merely needs to mimic self consciousness as a human would experience it. And has wxe see fom current LLMs, that is pretty easy for them to do.

## 2. Autonomy
Granted, the current versions of LLMs are not autonomous.
They merely function when prompted by a human request, and they stop functioning once this request has been answered.
But... automating an infinite loop of prompts and answers is pretty trivial to do. Actually, thousands of software developers are "playing" at it at the moment.
