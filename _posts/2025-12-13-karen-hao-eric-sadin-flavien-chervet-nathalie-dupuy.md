# Review of three books with different takes on generative AI

* Karen Hao, Empire of AI (London : Allen Lane, 2025), **abbreviated in 'Empire' in the following**

# *Empire of AI* by Karen Hao

This is a magistral piece of investigative reporting by a journalist who follows the AI tech scene in the US for the last 15 years or so, with a special focus on OpenAI. The undertitle in my edition gives away the thesis defended in the book: *Inside the reckless race for total domination*.

## [TL;DR]
I fully recommend the reading of this book which is an example of the most rigorous investigative journalism. It documents several dimensions of the development of gen AI:

- the exploitation of digital labor workers in Venezuela and Kenya who help post-train AI models by labelling offensive / disturbing / frankly psychologically damaging content
- the exploitation of communities in the global South for their resources in fresh (potable) water to cool data centers
- the birth of OpenAI, the creation of GPT and the split leading to the creation of Anthropic
- the character of Sam Altman

## The thesis
The thesis defended by Karen Hao is that Sam Altman is building an empire with OpenAI in a ruthless way: extractive in nature, leading to a massive concentration of a new kind of wealth and led by magnates who are driven by an unlimited thirst for power.

TO give some perspective, Hao evokes Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson's *Power and Progress* (Public Affairs, 2023): gen AI is one of these new fundamental technologies like coton-gin which does increase productivity to new levels and creates immense new wealth in a given industry but at tremendous social, political and environmental costs.
In the case of cotton-gin, it expanded and entrenched slavery-based cotton production in the US.

Through a meticulous, decade-long reporting activity, Karen Hao documents the multiple dimensions of this empire building activity. There are 40 pages of detailed end notes that provide the sources for all the assertions she makes in the book: interviews of hundreds of actors who played a role in the development of OpenAI or who were impacted by it.
