## üß© Comparison: JSF + PrimeFaces vs HTMX + Alpine.js


I develop nocodefunctions.com for 4 years now. Being a Java developer with limited skills and taste for front-end development, I rely on JSF + Primefaces for the front-end, integrated with the backend through JakartaEE.

Trying to achieve a better, more personal design of the web pages, I realized that my current stack was not making it easy.

I also use Gemini or ChatGPT's canvases a lot to imagine this redesign. These canvases can't render the xhtml files that are central to my current tech stack.

So, what if I made a different choice for my frontend stack, for a better experience as a front end developer? What would I loose, what would I gain?

Here is a comparison between my current stack (JSF + Primefaces) and the alternative I am considering (htmx + alpine.js + tailwind)


|   | **JSF + PrimeFaces (strengths)**                                                            | **HTMX + Alpine.js (cons)**                                                       |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Complex components out of the box (data tables, image croppers, etc.)                       | Lacks complex components ‚Äî requires specific JS libraries and custom backend code |
| 2 | Strong IDE integration: refactoring a backend method refactors the front end as well        | Logic is separated ‚Äî no automatic synchronization between front and back          |
| 3 | Same programming language and framework on both sides (e.g., file upload easily integrated) | Different languages/frameworks: file upload must be fully defined on both ends    |
| 4 | User session management provided out of the box                                             | No session mechanism ‚Äî must be implemented manually (cookies, tokens, etc.)       |
| 5 | Security and accessibility built into the framework                                         | No built-in security or accessibility mechanisms                                  |
| 6 | Easy internationalization (i18n) support                                                    | No i18n provided by default                                                       |
| 7 | Coherent default styling with theme support                                                 | Styling must be designed entirely from scratch                                    |
| 8 | Proven, long-term ecosystem (20+ years, likely stable for 20 more)                          | Younger frameworks ‚Äî shorter historical lifespan and uncertain long-term support  |

| - | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Static HTML files (not server-generated): easy to host, patch, and reload; ensures fast loading | XHTML pages are server-generated, requiring full app redeployment (including backend) for any small UI or CSS/JS change |
| 2 | Simple Nginx setup: one route for static assets, one for each API endpoint                      | Complex Nginx configuration required for JSF applications                                                               |
| 3 | Transparent handling of Server-Sent Events (SSE), including through Nginx                       | SSE handling is a ‚Äúblack box,‚Äù difficult to debug behind a proxy                                                        |
| 4 | Manual styling = total creative freedom and perfect consistency between pages and components    | Default component styling is hard to override and align with custom page design                                         |
| 5 | Excellent compatibility with LLMs (HTML/CSS/JS easily generated and previewed)                  | LLMs cannot preview XHTML pages ‚Äî breaks interactive design workflows                                                   |
| 6 | Strong and active open-source community (HTMX, Alpine, Tailwind)                                | JSF and PrimeFaces communities are small and aging                                                                      |
| 7 | Close to native HTML: lightweight, transparent, and easily replaceable if needed                | Heavy abstraction over HTML, with complex internal JS/CSS layers that obscure rendering and server interaction          |
