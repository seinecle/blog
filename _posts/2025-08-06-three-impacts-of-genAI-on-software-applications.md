These are very short notes to categorize and clarify how gen AI impacts existing software applications.

# Positive change

## 1. Easier software development
Gen AI acts as an augmented suit: developpers become better developers. They can code more complex tasks, quicker. A team of developers has an extended potential.
Or the the same potential can be achieved with a reduced team. Or even: a reduced team still has an extended potential.

# Negative change
(negative or disruptive or risky: your pick)

## 1. Entire classes of text-handling software are made obsolete by a ChatGPT-like interface
A couple of days ago, I have seen a fellow academic announcing the coming launch of his new web app: a service for students to revise, comment and predict the grade of the Master thesis they are working on.

-> this is obsolete by design. Just uploading the draft of the thesis to ChatGPT provides the student with all the feedback they need. With less friction.

Take away: Grammarly, Deepl, and a large numbers of software applications manipulating textual documents are replacable by prompting ChatGPT for the exact service, for free.

## 2. Software specializing in finding needles in a haystack are at risk of getting bypassed
I remember these two contrasting posts:

a. on the reddit channel for OSINT, [a recent post asking whether genAI was useful to fellow OSINT researchers](https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/comments/1lrjcv0/osint_and_ai/).
The best voted answer starts with:

> "Personally as AI researcher I have zero trust in anything LLM spews out. "

b. Rouhgly in the same period, Ethan Mollick (that I advise absolutely to follow) posted this:

I changed one line of War and Peace, inserting a sentence into Book 14, Chapter 10 (halfway through), where Princess Mary &quot;spoke to Crab Man the superhero.&quot;

Gemini 2.5 consistently found this reference among 860,00 tokens.<br><br><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:flxq4uyjfotciovpw3x3fxnu/post/3lokji4dwpc2z?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p>&mdash; Ethan Mollick (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:flxq4uyjfotciovpw3x3fxnu?ref_src=embed">@emollick.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:flxq4uyjfotciovpw3x3fxnu/post/3lokji4dwpc2z?ref_src=embed">7 mai 2025 Ã  06:06</a></blockquote>

-> in my view, OSINT researchers should be a bit more curious about gen AI capabilities for their trade.
