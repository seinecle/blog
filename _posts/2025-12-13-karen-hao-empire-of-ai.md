# *Empire of AI* by Karen Hao

Published in May 2025, [Empire of AI](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/460331/empire-of-ai-by-hao-karen/9780241678923) is a magistral piece of investigative reporting by [Karen Hao](https://karendhao.com/), a journalist who follows the AI tech scene in the US for the last 15 years or so, with a special focus on OpenAI. The undertitle in my edition gives away the thesis defended in the book: *Inside the reckless race for total domination*.

## [TL;DR]
I fully recommend the reading of this book which is an example of the most rigorous investigative journalism. It documents several dimensions of the development of gen AI:

- the exploitation of digital labor workers in Venezuela and Kenya who help post-train AI models by labelling offensive / disturbing / frankly psychologically damaging content
- the exploitation of communities in the global South for their resources in fresh (potable) water to cool data centers
- the birth of OpenAI, the creation of GPT and the split leading to the creation of Anthropic
- the character of Sam Altman

## The thesis
The thesis defended by Karen Hao is that Sam Altman is building an empire with OpenAI in a ruthless way: extractive in nature, leading to a massive concentration of a new kind of wealth and driven by an unlimited thirst for power.

To give some perspective, Hao evokes Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson's [*Power and Progress* (Public Affairs, 2023)](https://shapingwork.mit.edu/power-and-progress/): gen AI is one of these new fundamental technologies like cotton-gin which does increase productivity to new levels and creates immense new wealth in a given industry but at tremendous social, political and environmental costs.
In the case of cotton-gin, it expanded and entrenched slavery-based cotton production in the US.

Through a meticulous, decade-long reporting activity, Karen Hao documents the multiple dimensions of this empire building activity. There are 40 pages of detailed end notes that provide the sources for all the assertions she makes in the book: including the interviewing of hundreds of actors who played a role in the development of OpenAI or who were impacted by it.

## I am not convinced by...
Karen Hao chooses to bring in and document Annie Altman's life story, in her effort to fully document Sam Altman's personality and vision of the world.
No doubt it was a long matured decision and there are new, interesting directions in journalism that can justify this approach.

I was reminded for example of Elon Musk's conflictual relation to his father.
At Elon Musk' request, [his first biographer](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/419660/elon-musk-by-ashlee-vance/9780753555644) chose not to address this issue, with the benefit in return that the author gained an elevated access to Elon Musk.

Elon Musk' [second biographer](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Elon-Musk/Walter-Isaacson/9781982181284) chose the opposite.
Delving in (NB : yes I am in control of this sentence and this particular verb) Elon Musk' relationship with his father became a central key to the psyche of his subject, and my impression is that in consequence the second biography provides much deeper and valuable insights into Elon Musk' trajectory.

But in the case of Sam Altman's relation to his sister? My personal impression is that it did not provide a missing key to Sam Altman's psyche, decisions or trajectory. In consequence, it left me ill at ease. Discussing how individuals live and cope with their close relatives who suffer mental health issues, and then making broad and fragile inferences from it: tough call.

## Last impression
The creation and evolution of OpenAI, Sam Altman, the watershed moment of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, the ousting and reinstatement of Sam Altman, the split of OpenAI employees who went on to create Anthropic, the costs in electricity and water of new data centers built to train AI models, the stealing of copyrighted material through unfiltered, blanket scrapping of the web, the exploitation of workers to fine tune these models: this book provides factuals on all these crucial issues, with rigor and strong independence. For all these reasons I strongly recommend to read it!
