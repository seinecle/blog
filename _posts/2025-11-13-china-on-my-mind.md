# Noteworthy in November 2025, re China from a European perspective

↗️ in increasing order of significance, with a tie for the last two:

* november 5: [Shein opens within BHV, a Parisian flagship store, triggers protests](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/11/05/shein-opens-first-permanent-store-in-paris-amid-heavy-police-presence_6747136_7.html)
* november 12: [JD, a kind of Chinese equivalent to Amazon, takes an increased participation in Europen retail stores](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2025/11/12/amid-shein-controversy-chinese-e-commerce-giant-jd-com-sets-sights-on-european-market_6747395_19.html) - [archived version](https://archive.is/kR6cn)
* november 11:[How the world’s biggest mining project is a win for China](https://www.ft.com/content/9fe8f588-5383-4fde-b2f7-11fcbb206384) - [archived version](https://archive.is/bLAyv)
* november 12: [Can anything halt the decline of German industry?](https://www.ft.com/content/239eed1b-a268-42ec-861e-fc3047f47c32) - [archived version](https://archive.is/v1zSg)

The decline of the German industry has dire implications for Germany itself but also directly for Europe. Germany is the prime contributor to the EU budget which is an engine for redistribution, investment, research and education, cultural initiatives all across European countries.
If you live in Europe, you must be familiar with these signs on public buildings being renovated (schools, museums, infrastructures...), "EU participated to the funding of this equipment".

If and as Germany's welfare state gets threatened, Germany will reduce their participation to the EU budget. All other EU countries are in the same situation as Germany relative to China by the way, so that is going to be a general movement.

In areas where EU investment matters (and name one where it doesn't?), we should brace for more difficult times.
