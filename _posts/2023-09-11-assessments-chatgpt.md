A new academic year is starting, the first one since chatgpt has been released. Time to deliver on the intention to "revise and improve our teaching and evaluation"!

# ChatGPT: opportunities and threats
I personally consider ChatGPT (short for generative AI in general) is indeed a fundamental, important innovation which will bring radical changes in the short term (see my blog post from Dec 2022, alo in French here).

ChatGPT makes it easier to find answers on the web, draft content, explore a problem, to list usage I experimented.
These are fascinating opportunities.

But at the same time, ChatGPT can become a substitute for learning, which I would list as a threat.
I have witnessed it first hand when students submitted ChatGPT-generated answers to my assignments in Spring classes.
With this experience, I hope to do better this term.

# Assessment not banning ChatGPT but avoiding mindless copy pasting: challenge accepted
The goal is to find ways to provide the best of both worlds of ChatGPT to my students:

- allowing for the use of ChatGPT to leverage its potentialities
- all while avoiding the situation where disengaged students would do some mechanical copy pasting to pass the exam with absolutely zero knowledge on the subject.

First, let me say that I considered many options, and that oral examinations first had my strong favor.
But at group sizes around 40 students, and literally a dozen of groups to teach, I would have spent days and weeks sitting doing these oral examinations (or grading them in asynch mode).
I'll definitely keep oral examinations for resits though.

So, the setup:

1. one in-class assessment per teaching session. One assignment lasts 30 minutes, at the end of a 3 hours session.
2. the in-class assignments are simplistic scenarios that leverage and put to work the concepts seen just before in class
3. the assignment is formatted as a powerpoint and avoids the format of a Q&A.
4. I grade only 2 of the 4 in-class assignments - but students don't know in advance which 2 of the 4 will be graded
5. ChatGPT and access to Internet is not forbidden during the assignment.
6. Added a codicille to the evaluation grid: generic answers can be discounted at the liberty of the grader.

 # Going into the details of the setup

 I'll go through each of the 5 points above as they all matter very much:

 ## One in-class assignment per teaching session
I owe this idea to my colleague Lisa Buchter, which I witnessed in a class of hers I was shadowing.
In 3 hours teaching sessions, the last 30 minutes are usually a struggle for everyone.
Turning it into an assignment brings back concentration and focus in an astonishing way.
Students basically don't want to leave the classroom when the bell rings!
Too busy finishing their assignments :-)
And the fact that each teaching session has one assignment allows for shorter assignments, taylored exactly to the class.

In the context of a ChatGPT world, staying in-class helps the professor monitor how students use it.
Just walking through the aisles, you see which student is basically working with ChatGPT open in front, and those who try to answer the assignment directly.
It gives some empirical feedback on the practices.

## Assignment directly addressing the content just seen in class
Having an assignment dealing directly with was discussed in the hour right before, tends to give more confidence to the students in their capacity to answer correctly to the questions: it is still fresh in memory.
This gives a better chance for the students to try and reason by themselves (they have it in mind!) instead of offloading the task to ChatGPT in a mindless way.

## Powerpoint to the rescue (who would have guessed...)
The questions are scenarios which give some contextual elements, scattered on different pages, which obliges students to provide contextualized answers, not direct follow-ups to a generic prompt.
In the same spirit of discouraging a mechanical process of prompt > answer, the document format is not an MS Word but a Powerpoint with tables and unusual diagrammatic designs, because this spatial configuration does not lend itself to a direct solving through ChatGPT.
The goal is not to prevent the use of ChatGPT, but to encourage students to have a strategic use of it - and opening up the possiblity that a non ChatGPT aided answer might be simpler and make more sense.

## Grading 2 out of 4 assignnents
This one is very operational: sophisticated ways to improve the type of evaluations in the age of ChatGPT often falter because of the load of grading they induce.
I almost forgot about and was preparing a hell of a term for myself in terms of grading, just imagine: grading 40 copies **after each class**.
