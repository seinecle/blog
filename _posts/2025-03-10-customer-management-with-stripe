Today, I'm thrilled to share how I recently updated my web app, [nocodefunctions.com](https://nocodefunctions.com), transitioning to a simple, secure, and extremely lightweight approach to user management and payments. Inspired by Pieter Levels (@levelsio) and closely following the customer management approach he used for [photoai.com](https://photoai.com), my goal was to minimize complexity and maximize security, by offloading nearly all customer management tasks directly to Stripe. This change marks a significant improvement in both the user experience and backend maintainability. Here's an in-depth look at how and why I implemented this approach:

# Why Simplify?

As an indie Java developer balancing a demanding full-time academic career, managing complex user authentication, account security, and billing flows quickly becomes overwhelming. Complex infrastructures not only require substantial maintenance effort but also introduce security vulnerabilities. By leveraging Stripeâ€™s powerful yet straightforward capabilities, I completely eliminated the need to handle sensitive user credentials like passwords or payment details on my servers. Stripe securely manages everything from subscriptions and payments to essential customer metadata.

# The Simplified Flow:

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the new simplified approach works:

1. **User Interaction**:

   - Users sign up or log in simply by entering their email address.
   - Immediately after submission, a unique, secure login link is emailed directly to themâ€”no passwords needed.

2. **Checkout with Stripe**:

   - Users have the option to select one of two premium plans: "Pro" or "Patron."
   - Selecting a plan seamlessly redirects users to Stripe's secure and user-friendly hosted checkout page, completely removing any billing complexity from my application.

3. **Post-Payment Process**:

   - Upon successful payment, Stripe sends a webhook notification to my backend.
   - Stripe securely stores critical user information such as email, subscription details, remaining credits, and a unique user hash (identifier).
   - My application interacts with Stripe through simple API calls, retrieving only necessary information without ever accessing sensitive payment data.

# Technical Highlights:

- **Passwordless Authentication**: Completely eliminates traditional authentication mechanisms, thereby significantly reducing security vulnerabilities associated with password management.
- **Stripe-hosted Billing Portal**: Users independently manage their subscriptions, payment methods, billing history, and refunds through Stripe's comprehensive billing interface, drastically reducing backend responsibilities.
- **Secure Metadata Handling**: Critical user information like unique hashes, subscription tiers, and usage credits are securely managed by Stripe, ensuring reliable data protection and integrity.

# Enhanced Schematic Overview:

```
User â†’ nocodefunctions.com
     â†“ enters email
Email â†’ User (secure login link)
     â†“ clicks link to login
User â†’ Stripe Hosted Checkout (Plan selection & secure payment)
     â†“ successful payment
Stripe â†’ Webhook notification â†’ nocodefunctions.com
     â†“                                â†˜ User metadata securely stored
User gains immediate access via unique hash
```

### Benefits:

This simplified approach significantly improves security by eliminating the storage of passwords and sensitive financial information, thereby greatly reducing potential security breaches. Additionally, it drastically reduces application complexity, resulting in fewer bugs and easier ongoing maintenance. By leveraging Stripeâ€™s robust infrastructure, scaling becomes seamless, requiring no additional backend complexity or resource overhead. Moreover, users benefit from greater empowerment, gaining full control over billing, subscriptions, and account management through Stripeâ€™s intuitive interface, enhancing overall trust and user satisfaction.

### Supporting Open Source

This freemium approach not only sustains the development of nocodefunctions but also supports broader open-source initiatives, such as my own contributions and tools like [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). Users can confidently use core functionalities for free while choosing premium plans to directly support continuous improvement and sustainability.
