These are personal notes on latest news on generative AI (late August / early September) and on fundamental trends behind these news. This is a follow-up to [this post](/three-impacts-of-genAI-on-software-applications/).

# Robotics and generative AI: interlinked
I remember an impactful talk in 2017 by [Laurent Alexandre](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Alexandre) for a commission of the French Senate, where he hammered the economic significance of AI.
Still very much worth watching:

In this talk, Laurent Alexandre highlighted a difference in progress rates between AI and robotics: AI is software based (not only, but significantly) and software has an exponential rate of development.
Robotics is hardware, which has a slower pace of development.
**For this reason we should expect great strides on the AI front, and a somewhat less exciting newsfront on robotics.**
This is how I interpreted the argument at least, and it struck me as a great insight, even if in hindsight I could have derived it from the ['bits are easier to move than atoms' adage from 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_Digital).

Anyway, my point is to say that in 2025 the development of robotics, especially in China, should not make us draw too sharp a distinction between the domains of AI and robotics, in terms of product development and economic impact.
Some might react with "duh, of course Clement you are the only one who would draw such a silly distinction".

But may I remind you of the not-so-long-ago period (2015-2022, I'd say) when we were witnessing the quick progress of machine learning in all directions, while on the robotics front we were just with Boston Dynamics posting ~ 2 videos per year [with a robot doing parkour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4DML7FIWk)?  

In the past months I read postings that made me realize that robotics is now an industry that is developing in the direction of consumer products and that can change fundamentals of our culture, with humanoid robots. Not just welding arms in factories:

A couple of readings in the past weeks have finished putting the issue in front of my reading interests:

### August 16, Robotics olympiads in China

### August 18, a thread on the "How China bought Germany's robotics crown jewel"

Quick to read and fascinating:

### September 2, report on the surge of robotics in China

Quoting from the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/cf427f83-89b2-4912-8f79-0f367ab6e553):

> Chinese factories are installing about 280,000 industrial robots every year, **or half the global total** [my emphasis], bringing the countryâ€™s robot-to-worker density ahead of Germany and closing in on leader South Korea, according to the International Federation of Robotics.

[This video from the article above](https://next-media-api.ft.com/clips/optimised-media-files/17567766673420/1920x1080.mp4) shows nicely how advanced arm robots are integrated seemingly routinely in non high tech, "regular" factory floors.


### September 3, Chinese military parade

The [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/ac2f48f2-6faa-4ecd-af58-bc2665fbe427) notes:

> "A range of aerial drones for attack and surveillance were also on display, and many of the ground forces that participated in the parade had autonomous elements in their gear, such as small surveillance drones mounted on tanks and robot dogs carried on the back of electronic warfare equipment."


### September 3, yet another impressive robot demo by Figure  

[Figure](https://www.figure.ai/) is a [US robotics company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_AI)

# What to make of it?
I take it for granted that China has surpassed the US in terms of AI x robotics, with the US a close second in 2025. I also take it for granted that robots will enter consumer culture (as opposed to B2B) in some years. Professionnally, I also prepare for the following:

- intensification of relations between EU and China: commercially, educationally, culturally, ... anything that reflects China's standing as leader on robotics x AI, Europe being the not-so-powerful client in the relation.
- displacement of the equilibrium point in the wealth distribution between China and the rest of the world, in favor of China. Quite logical, and with supportive evidence of two kinds:

  a. development of robotics in China seem not to hurt their labour force (which complements robots and upskills), quite the contrary: 

<img alt="Homegrown robots help drive Chinaâ€™s global export surge" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd5e2fab-54bd-4361-9e25-9b53b7ecec21" style="max-width: 100%; width: 460px; height: auto;"/>



> source: "Homegrown robots help drive Chinaâ€™s global export surge", [Financial Times, September 3, 2025](https://www.ft.com/content/cf427f83-89b2-4912-8f79-0f367ab6e553).

  b. If [AI accelerates economic growth](https://www.ft.com/content/887531bf-646a-46b5-a821-649d3948a574), places where AI is the most embedded in the production and consumer's systems will mostly enact and benefit from this growth. Today, China is exactly this place.

# Conclusion
I wanted to also discuss nano banana, Carrefour and the creation of 3D assets in the latest news but that will be for another time.
