Comparing Wan, VEO, SORA, LUMA and GROK with a paper boat navigating on a mountain torrent.

Prompt (I am not a native English speaker and was too lazy on that one to check for correctness) :

```
Make a video of a paper boat descending and whirling in a natural torrent water stream from the Alps.

A few natural rocks are in the torrent, the torrent is small and the banks are made of herb, flowers, small bushes, in spring season.

No wild life.

Just the boat descending on the stream, with realistic physics for lights, water and boat movements: it whirls, slows down and goes faster depending on the current.
```

*All generations are first try*

**Except for LUMA the video generation also generates sound, so please SOUND ON on the videos.** 

### LUMA (RAY 3)

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

- Time to generate : about 1 minute if I remember correctly.
- Where? on a free plan on Luma Labs's dream machine: [https://dream-machine.lumalabs.ai/](https://dream-machine.lumalabs.ai/)
- Evaluation: my paper boat is navigating the stream up! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Also, no sound.
- Remarks: I made a second try where the paper boat sails [more naturally, downstream](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eace0c9c-52e7-4749-8fec-0e8dbfc7b8e6).



### WAN 2.5

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

- Time to generate: at least 20 minutes . It took so long that I closed the tab and came back several hours later
- Where? on a free plan with [https://create.wan.video/generate](https://create.wan.video/generate)
- Evaluation: great fidelity to the prompt, level of details, great sound. The movement of the boat is not really coherent though (should not be so idle given the current)


### GROK

<video controls width="640">
  <source src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2f3ebda-a948-4c7e-9d37-d292a13916f9" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

- Time to generate: less than a minute.
- Where? on a free plan with [https://grok.com/imagine](https://grok.com/imagine)
- Evaluation: no photo realistic, movement of the boat is not natural, resolution is low, sound is compressed


### SORA 2

<video controls width="640">
  <source src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07829bb3-10fe-41b2-875c-2f89fbc7b36e" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

- Time to generate: between 5 and 10 minutes if I recall correctly
- Where? on a free plan with [https://vidgo.ai/](https://vidgo.ai/)
- Evaluation: photo realistic, camera angles feel elaborated, movement of the boat is so natural, resolution is high and even the blur feels as if an amateur would have shooted out of focus. Sound is realistic and detailed though not perfect.

# Conclusion

Wan comes as a close second to SORA in my honest opinion.

This quick comparison was made in relation to a list I maintain on [AI apps for visual creation: image, video, dubbing, 3D models and more](https://nocodefunctions.com/blog/list-of-ai-apps-for-visual-creation/).
