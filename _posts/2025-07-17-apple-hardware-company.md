Why does Apple feel kind of quaint nowadays? Because they do hardware when the gravity center has shifted to sofware.

# What is Apple producing?

Macbooks, iPhones, iPods, iWatches, ... I probably forgot a couple of things but: on top of my mind, I got not piece of software in this list.

Let's do the same with Microsoft, its rival from the 1990s:

Windows, Microsoft Office, Github, LinkedIn, Visual Studio, TypeScript, Azure, XBox, plus a very large stake in OpenAI.
