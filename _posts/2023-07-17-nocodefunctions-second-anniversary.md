*[Nocode functions](https://nocodefunctions.com/) is a free, no-registration web app for click-and-point data analysis*

In this post, I make a list of the improvements brought to [nocode functions](https://nocodefunctions.com/) in the past year.

# Key facts over the past year

According to the Wayback machine, I have launched nocodefunctions [around May 2021](http://web.archive.org/web/20210503153337/https://nocodefunctions.com/).
Last year, I celebrated its [first anniversary with a blog post](https://nocodefunctions.com/blog/nocodefunctions-is-one-year-old/) - go have a look!

# Overall feeling

# Quality, user friendliness
- The promise has not changed. Nocode functions remains free, fully translated in 107 languages, requires no registration, and is respectful of your data. Just click and analyze your data!
- The app experienced no significant downtime. Users could rely on it 24/24, 365 days a year. How? Simply: when I feel that I will introduce a change that can break the app, I try the change on a test copy of nocodefunctions, which is: [https://**test**.nocodefunctions.com](https://test.nocodefunctions.com). When everything is stabilized, I deploy the changes on the normal address of nocodefunctions: https://nocodefunctions.com.
- The app remained super fast to load, functions were fast or faster to run, and more error messages were introduced when unexpected errors occurred.
- The overall design and usage flow remained the same: choose a function, upload your data, select optional parameters, run the function, see the results, download the results.
- An ugly error in the design of the web pages has been permanently fixed. It made some functions unusable because the buttons on the pages couldn't be clicked. It was very hard to diagnose, it disappeared and came back randomly without leaving clear errors. I could finally fix it (two [CSS files](https://webplatform.github.io/docs/tutorials/learning_what_css_is/) were colliding), thanks to the detailed reports by [Veronica Espinoza](https://twitter.com/Verukita1).

This app is truly built on the shoulders of giants. Fully developed in [Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRubcjpTkks) using [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) as a coding tool, I thank the community for developing such a versatile, robust, easy-to-use programming language and tooling. Thanks also to all the maintainers of the libraries that provide specific features. And thanks to all the users who provided feedback, big or not, anonymously or not.
