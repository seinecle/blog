Seizing the nature and consequences of generative AI is an exercise in speculation. But we can speculate with method.

> in the following I use "ChatGPT", "LLM" and "generative AI" interchangeably because ChatGPT and Large Language Models (LLMs) are front examples of generative AI.

# The consequences of generative AI - why do we care?
For the sake of keeping this blog post short, I'll just mention that Geoffrey Hinton, who is a key contributor to generative AI, compared it to the invention of electricity, or [even the invention *of the wheel*](https://youtu.be/qpoRO378qRY?feature=shared&t=2295):

So we should probably pay attention and as the interviewer said, "let's buckle up".

# How to explore the consequences of a radically new fundamental technology? Caveats
I must say I lack the experience that academics and colleagues possess in exactly this topic, with [Philippe Silberzahn on how to face disruptive innovations](https://philippesilberzahneng.com) or [Thomas Gauthier on conducting far reaching prospective studies](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-gauthier-1473b62/).
I will simply list and organiz the different influential visions for generative AI that I have read and encountered in the past months.

The goal is very modest: it is to provide you with a panorama of visions by people whose opinions are usually well informed.
Let us not forget that of course, each of them have a stake in the debate, and that their voice is performative: by articulating a vision, they contribute to this vision becoming reality, even modestly.

# About me
I am a [professor at emlyon business school](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levallois/) where I conduct research in Natural Language Processing and network analysis applied to social sciences and the humanities. I teach about the impact of digital technologies on business and society. I  build [nocode functions](https://nocodefunctions.com) ðŸ”Ž, a click and point web app to explore texts and networks. It is [fully open source](https://github.com/seinecle/nocodefunctions). Try it and give some feedback, I would appreciate it!
