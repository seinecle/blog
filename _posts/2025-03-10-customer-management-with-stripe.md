Today, I'm thrilled to share how I recently updated my web app, [nocodefunctions.com](https://nocodefunctions.com), adding to a simple, secure, and extremely lightweight approach to user management and payments. Inspired by Pieter Levels (@levelsio) and closely following the customer management approach he used for [photoai.com](https://photoai.com), my goal was to minimize complexity and maximize security, by offloading nearly all customer management tasks directly to Stripe. This change marks a significant improvement in both the user experience and backend maintainability. Here's an in-depth look at how and why I implemented this approach:

# Why Simplify?

As an indie Java developer balancing a demanding full-time academic career, managing complex user authentication, account security, and billing flows quickly would have been overwhelming. Complex infrastructures not only require substantial maintenance effort but also introduce security vulnerabilities. By leveraging Stripeâ€™s capabilities, I completely eliminated the need to handle sensitive user credentials like passwords or payment details on my servers. Stripe securely manages everything from subscriptions and payments to essential customer metadata.

# The Simplified Flow:

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the new simplified approach works:

1. **User Interaction**:

   - Users sign up or log in simply by entering their email address.
   - Immediately after submission, a unique login link is emailed directly to themâ€”no passwords needed.

2. **Checkout with Stripe**:

   - Users have the option to select one of two premium plans: "Pro" or "Patron."
   - Selecting a plan redirects users to Stripe's secure and user-friendly hosted checkout page, completely removing any billing complexity from my application.
   - A customer is created on Stripe with two values stored on it: a hash (long String value), and a credit amount.

3. **Post-Payment Process**:

   - Upon successful payment, Stripe sends a webhook notification to my backend, with the hash value of the customer. From there on, the hash value or the email of the user will be used to identify / retrieve their info from Stripe.
   - Stripe securely stores critical user information such as email, subscription details, remaining credits, and a unique user hash (identifier).
   - My application interacts with Stripe through simple API calls, retrieving only necessary information without ever accessing sensitive payment data. Typically, just decrementing the credit amount each time the user makes use of the service.

# Technical Highlights:

- **Passwordless Authentication**: Completely eliminates traditional authentication mechanisms, thereby significantly reducing security vulnerabilities associated with password management.
- **Stripe-hosted Billing Portal**: Users independently manage their subscriptions, payment methods, billing history, and refunds through Stripe's comprehensive billing interface, drastically reducing backend responsibilities.
- **Secure Metadata Handling**: Critical user information like unique hashes, subscription tiers, and usage credits are securely managed by Stripe, ensuring reliable data protection and integrity.

# Enhanced Schematic Overview:

```
User â†’ nocodefunctions.com
     â†“ enters email
Email â†’ User (secure login link)
     â†“ clicks link to login
User â†’ Stripe Hosted Checkout (Plan selection & secure payment)
     â†“ successful payment
Stripe â†’ Webhook notification â†’ nocodefunctions.com
     â†“                                â†˜ User metadata securely stored: a credit amount, basically
User gains immediate access via unique hash
```

### Benefits:

This approach significantly improves security by eliminating the storage of passwords and any sensitive financial information, thereby greatly reducing potential security breaches. Additionally, it drastically reduces application complexity, resulting in fewer bugs and easier ongoing maintenance. I have basically 3 classes:

- one class in the front end listing operations with Stripe. These ops are not made by the front end but delegated to a separate backend module.
- this backend module does what the name of the methods suggest: very basic stuff ("retrieve customer email by hash", "retrieve customer hash by email", "get remaining credits", etc.)
- this backend has also webhooks: endpoints that receive Stripe push notifications, again very simple stuff: notifcation of customer creation (triggers the creation of a hash and a credit amount for this customer)... that's it. 

By leveraging Stripeâ€™s infrastructure, scaling becomes seamless, requiring no additional backend complexity or resource overhead. Moreover, users benefit from greater empowerment (and I benefit from peace of mind) because they gain full control over billing, subscriptions, and account management through Stripeâ€™s billing portal.

### Supporting Open Source

This freemium approach not only sustains the development of nocodefunctions but also supports broader open-source initiatives, such as my own contributions and tools like [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). Users can confidently use core functionalities for free while choosing premium plans to support continuous improvement and sustainability.
